Forecasting with `modeltime.h2o` made easy! This short tutorial shows how you can use:

-   **H2O AutoML** for forecasting implemented via `automl_reg()`. This function trains and cross-validates multiple machine learning and deep learning models (XGBoost GBM, GLMs, Random Forest, GBMs...) and then trains two Stacked Ensembled models, one of all the models, and one of only the best models of each kind. Finally, the best model is selected based on a stopping metric. And we take care of all this for you!

-   **Save & Load Models** functionality to ensure the persistence of your models.

## Libraries

Load the following libraries:

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(modeltime.h2o)
library(tidyverse)
library(timetk)
```

## Collect data and split into training and test sets

Next, we load the `walmart_sales_weekly` data containing 7 time series and visualize them using the `timetk::plot_time_series()` function.

```{r}
data_tbl <- walmart_sales_weekly %>%
    select(id, Date, Weekly_Sales)

data_tbl %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  plot_time_series(
      .date_var    = Date,
      .value       = Weekly_Sales,
      .facet_ncol  = 2,
      .smooth      = F,
      .interactive = F
  )
```

Then, we separate the data with the `initial_time_split()` function and generate a training dataset and a test one.

```{r}
splits <- time_series_split(data_tbl, assess = "3 month", cumulative = TRUE)

recipe_spec <- recipe(Weekly_Sales ~ ., data = training(splits)) %>%
    step_timeseries_signature(Date) 

train_tbl <- training(splits) %>% bake(prep(recipe_spec), .)
test_tbl  <- testing(splits) %>% bake(prep(recipe_spec), .)
```

## Model specification, training and prediction

In order to correctly use modeltime.h2o, it is necessary to connect to an H2O cluster through the `h2o.init()` function. You can find more information on how to set up the cluster by typing `?h2o.init` or by visiting the [official site](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/starting-h2o.html).

```{r}
h2o.init(
    nthreads = -1,
    ip       = 'localhost',
    port     = 54321
)
```

Now comes the fun part! We define our model specification with the `automl_reg()` function and pass the arguments through the engine:

```{r}
model_spec <- automl_reg(mode = 'regression') %>%
    set_engine(
         engine                     = 'h2o',
         max_runtime_secs           = 5, 
         max_runtime_secs_per_model = 3,
         max_models                 = 3,
         nfolds                     = 5,
         exclude_algos              = c("DeepLearning"),
         verbosity                  = NULL,
         seed                       = 786
    ) 

model_spec
```

Next, let's train the model with `fit()`!

```{r, message=FALSE}
model_fitted <- model_spec %>%
    fit(Weekly_Sales ~ ., data = train_tbl)

model_fitted
```

Finally, we `predict()` on the test dataset:

```{r, message=FALSE}
predict(model_fitted, test_tbl)
```

## Modeltime Workflow

Once we have our fitted model, we can follow the [Modeltime Workflow](https://business-science.github.io/modeltime/articles/getting-started-with-modeltime.html):

-   Add fitted models to a **Model Table**.

-   **Calibrate** the models to a testing set.

-   Perform Testing Set **Forecast Evaluation** & Accuracy Evaluation.

-   **Refit** the models to Full Dataset & Forecast Forward

## Add fitted models to a Model Table

First, we create the model table:

```{r}
modeltime_tbl <- modeltime_table(
    model_fitted
) 

modeltime_tbl
```

## Calibrate & Testing Set Forecast & Accuracy Evaluation

Next, we calibrate to the testing set and visualize the forecasts:

```{r, message=FALSE}
modeltime_tbl %>%
  modeltime_calibrate(test_tbl) %>%
    modeltime_forecast(
        new_data    = test_tbl,
        actual_data = data_tbl,
        keep_data   = TRUE
    ) %>%
    group_by(id) %>%
    plot_modeltime_forecast(
        .facet_ncol = 2, 
        .interactive = FALSE
    )
```

## Refit to Full Dataset & Forecast Forward

Before using **refit** on our dataset, let's prepare our data. We create `data_prepared_tbl` which represents the complete dataset (the union of train and test) with the variables created with the recipe named recipe_spec. Subsequently, we create the dataset `future_prepared_tbl` that represents the dataset with the future data to one year and the required variables.

```{r}
data_prepared_tbl <- bind_rows(train_tbl, test_tbl)

future_tbl <- data_prepared_tbl %>%
    group_by(id) %>%
    future_frame(.length_out = "1 year") %>%
    ungroup()

future_prepared_tbl <- bake(prep(recipe_spec), future_tbl)
```

Finally, we use forecast in our future dataset and visualize the results once we had reffited.

```{r, message=FALSE}
refit_tbl <- modeltime_tbl %>%
    modeltime_refit(data_prepared_tbl)

refit_tbl %>%
    modeltime_forecast(
        new_data    = future_prepared_tbl,
        actual_data = data_prepared_tbl,
        keep_data   = TRUE
    ) %>%
    group_by(id) %>%
    plot_modeltime_forecast(
        .facet_ncol  = 2,
        .interactive = FALSE
    )
```

We can likely do better than this if we train longer but really good for a quick example!

## Saving and Loading Models

H2O models will need to "serialized" (a fancy word for saved to a directory that contains the recipe for recreating the models). To save the models, use `save_h2o_model()`.

-   Provide a directory where you want to save the model.
-   This saves the model file in the directory.

```{r, eval = F}
model_fitted %>% 
  save_h2o_model(path = "../model_fitted", overwrite = TRUE)
```

You can reload the model into R using `load_h2o_model()`.

```{r, eval = F}
model_h2o <- load_h2o_model(path = "../model_fitted/")
```
